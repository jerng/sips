# Small, Interesting, Programs
I'm actually quite concerned that we still don't have a language agnostic framework of "small, interesting, programs" which are uniformly implemented in popular languages according to standards.

I'm not sure what can, or needs to be done here, so it is a matter of thoughts in progress.

## Operations ( Data i.e. operands )
To begin, it seems pertinent to lay out the domains of data which need to be operated on. Data domains need to be defined with the right level of abstraction, such that the operations which are developed to address them, are easily understood, widely applicable, and minimally risky.

# Data Domains i.e. dimensions

> the list below is non-exhaustive ; but having jotted it down as first-thoughts following the introduction above, I realise that this is probably turning into a metaphysical study on the nature of cognition and how to machine it effectively

## "times"

A dimension of general concern, as it's hard to think of a business case for anything without nailing it to a particular time.

## "physical spaces"

Things that "take up space", or more broadly, things that are "located at a space" : are a good starting point for describing human thoughts about the world. Without being so abstract as to refer to the general n-space of dimensionality, nor the manifold of spacetime, as the temporal dimension is applicable to non-physical spaces.

## "qualia i.e. sensations / superficial appearances"

Units of consciousness, really ... the legos of experience. These may be different from mind to mind. One mind may not perceive the colour red, another might. Likewise the direct perception of radio waves is something available to certain machines, but generally not to humans.

## "names i.e. a first degree of indirection"

In communications, signs that refer to any other entities, do take up space. But the space they take up, isn't the primarily part of their existence. They're just convenient handlers, for data structures i.e. ideas - allowing very complicated relationships to be referred to by simple names. Broadly this is covered in fields of study with hoary names like "semantics" and "semiotics".

## "rules"

Preferring not to think of these as Platonic ideals, it seems that ultimately the definition of a rule is reified in sensible models ... we build little empirical models, which are meant to be signs of broader states of affairs beyond the present reified model. The metaphysics of rules, and Humeian induction are good places to begin thinking about this.

"1+1=2" is meaningless, without at least one example. And someone the provisio of an example, results in a cognitive apparatus which can then identify the given example, as a special case of other situations.
